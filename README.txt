The file "solveTSPopt.py" is using to generate the data.
The file "optProblem.py" has the function which call the optimization solver.
The file "generateHistOptTSP.py" plots the histogram of the costs and the scatter of the points, from which we ifner that the dependance between the number of points and cost is a square root.
The file "fitSquareRootTSP" uses the data generated with solveTSPopt.py to fit a square-root model. It also plots the results.
